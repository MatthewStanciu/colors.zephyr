# colors.zephyr

**UPDATE 2022:** Inspired by this project, I built a better version that works on the real Internet with two friends over the summer. It's called "a colorful thing". Check it out [here](https://github.com/lachlanjc/a-colorful-thing).

A rudimentary version of [r/place](https://redditblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/place-final.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1000px%2C483px&resize=1200%2C580), made on [The Hacker Zephyr](https://zephyr.hackclub.com) in July 2021. Everyone on the Zephyr had a randomly-assigned color, which they used to fill squares on the canvas. The canvas updated for everyone live as people filled the squares with their colors. The original idea was that once a color was filled it could not be replaced, but I forgot to code that part before I shipped it, so people had fun replacing the canvas a few times over.

I posted a few updates on [Chronicles](https://chronicles.zephyrnet.hackclub.com/matthew) showing the progress of the canvas, if you're interested :D
